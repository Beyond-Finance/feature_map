title: Public Interface - Overview
---

FeatureMap provides many utilities via its bundled bin script (or when made into a bin script via [Inline Execution]({{ '/getting-started/inline-execution' | relative_url }})).

Generally, running `bin/featuremap help` will provide guidance on the available commands.  There are a few public methods that may be of interest, too, which can be found in the source:

Check out [`lib/feature_map.rb`](https://github.com/Beyond-Finance/feature_map/blob/main/lib/feature_map.rb) to see the public API.

Check out [`feature_map_spec.rb`](https://github.com/Beyond-Finance/feature_map/blob/main/spec/lib/feature_map_spec.rb) to see examples of how the feature map utility is used.
