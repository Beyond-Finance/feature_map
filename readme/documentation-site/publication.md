The generation of the Documentation Site results in the creation of two files:
  - `.feature_map/docs/index.html`
    - The html, css, and javascript that composes the entirety of the Documentation Site.
  - `.feature_map/docs/feature-map-config.js`
    - A javascript object injected into the `window` which contains all feature-specific metrics, project configuration, and environmental data used to render information within the Documentation Site

These two files may be uploaded to any system, e.g., GitHub Pages, that serves HTML sites, so that the Documentation Site may be published and available for use by your organization.
