title: Artifact Generation
---

Successful generation of the Documentation Site depends on a handful of artifacts that must be generated first.

- `.feature_map/metrics.yml`:
  - Generated by [`bin/featuremap validate`]({{ '/interface/validate' | relative_url }})
  - Stores basic size and complexity metrics
  - Required
- `.feature_map/test-coverage.yml`
  - Generated by [`bin/featuremap test_coverage`]({{ '/interface/test-coverage' | relative_url }})
  - Stores per-Feature aggregated test coverage data from codecov
  - Optional
- `.feature_map/test-pyramid.yml`
  - Generated by [`bin/featuremap test_pyramid`]({{ '/interface/test-pyramid' | relative_url }})
  - Stores per-Feature test pyramid data based on results from various RSpec runs
  - Optional
